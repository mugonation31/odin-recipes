  <h4>Fried Chicken</h4>
  <p>A fun chicken recipe the kids can help prepare. They love crushing the crackers. It does not matter if the
    measurements aren't perfect, just wing it!</p>

  <h1>Ingredients</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>30 saltine crackers</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons dry potato flakes</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>

  </ul>

  <h1>Steps</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Lay eggplant slices on paper towels; sprinkle lightly with salt. Let sit for 30 minutes to draw out moisture,
      then pat dry with paper towels.</li>
    <li>Warm olive oil in a skillet over high heat. Fry eggplant until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper
      towels; set aside.</li>
    <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in ground beef, onions, and garlic; season
      with salt and black pepper. Cook and stir until beef is browned, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add parsley, fines herbs, cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Pour in tomato sauce and wine; mix well. Simmer for
      20 minutes. Allow to cool, then stir in beaten egg.</li>
    <li>Scald milk in a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
    <li>At the same time, melt 1/2 cup butter in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Whisk flour into butter until smooth. Lower heat; gradually pour in scalded milk, whisking constantly until it
      thickens.
      Season béchamel sauce with salt and white pepper.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
    <li>Arrange a single layer of eggplant in the prepared baking dish.</li>
    <li>Cover eggplant with meat sauce, then sprinkle 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese on top. Cover with remaining eggplant and
      sprinkle
      another 1/2 cup cheese on top.</li>
    <li>Pour béchamel sauce on top and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Cover with remaining cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and browned, about 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
